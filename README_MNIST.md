# MNIST Dataset Classification from Scratch

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning classification solution for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset using only NumPy and Python standard libraries. By building the entire pipeline from scratch, the project provides a deep understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts and implementation details.

## Features

- **Pure Python Implementation**: No external machine learning libraries used
- **NumPy-based Computations**: Efficient numerical operations
- **Separate Training and Testing Modules**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance Visualization**: Included performance graphs and metrics

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for performance visualization)
